Refugee Response Analysis
============

This script pulls information from ActivityInfo and generates a series of analyses.

It uses a dedicated package: https://github.com/bedatadriven/activityinfo-R


The script is designed to be run on a monthly basis and to be improved in a collaborative way.

The results are:

- one dataframe per DB 
- extraction in csv for dataviz in dc.js
- reports per theme
- presentations (using slidify packages)

To start, look at the code folder.
